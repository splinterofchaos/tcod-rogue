HOW TO COMPILE

The only dependency is libtcod, which has several dependencies of its own. The
makefile will download and try to compile libtcod if the directory doesn't
exist, but it may require manually compiling if that doesn't work.

The fallowing (may) install all the needed dependencies on Ubuntu:
    sudo apt-get -y install zlib1g-dev libpng12-dev libsdl1.2-dev upx

You will also need g++ (4.6 or greater--below is untested), git, and mercurial.

If everything is set, a simple "make" should suffice. I had to move libtcod.so
and libtcodxx.so to /lib in order to run the executable. 
(There may be a better way).


HOW TO PLAY

Movement can be done with the arrow keys, number pad, or hjkl (classic). To
check out your surroundings, press L to enter look mode and use the movement
keys to move the cursor. Press any non-movement key to exit.

Attack a monster by running up to it. Quick monsters may move twice when you
move once and slow monsters may not move until your second turn.
